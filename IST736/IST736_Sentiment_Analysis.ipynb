The Yamazaki 18 is also sherried, but lighter sherry and slightly sweet compared to the Yamazaki Sherry Cask.  The Macallan 18, in comparison, has a deeper sherry flavor, likely due to the fact that it is a true Speyside character to balance.  The Sherry cask has a slightly more complex sherry nuance compared to Macallan 18, but they are so much alike it may be challenging to decipher the two in a blind taste test.I'm glad I had a chance to try it, as the novelty of being best whiskey that year in Murray's whiskey bible.  It is the best example of a sherried whiskey........somewhere between Macallan 18 and Ardbeg Dark Cove (a more heavily sherried islay), more closer to the former than the latter.\",\n",

Not from international sales.This coupled with the fact that there is only a handful of bottles allocated within the UK (most of which are already reserved for rich clientele and high end bars) I don\\'t see what\\'s unfair about it.If the US gets its allocation of bottles why should a folk from the states have a chance to buy from the UK site?

I cant afford a bottle but ill certainly be on the look out for a 3cl sample.Good luck to everyone.',\n",

There is a huge amount of global demand for this whisky and as one of the most acclaimed online retailers in the world, there will be a huge interest for places in the lottery from all corners of the globe.
