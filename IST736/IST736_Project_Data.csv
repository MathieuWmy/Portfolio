58,1,Yamazaki,The Great Japanese Whisky,I love Scotch Whisky but after have these Japanese Whisky (Yamazaki 12 / Hibiki 12 / Hibiki 17) the taste so Complexity than the Scotch. I'm wondering why they're all Sold Out  quickly  in Australia,1
59,1,Yamazaki,Great Japanese Whisky,I love scotch whisky but they're not complexity like Japanese Whisky ( Yamazaki 12 / Hibiki 12 etc... ) now I'm wondering why all these Japanese Whisky Sold out quickly the whole worldwide,1
60,1,Yamazaki,A good one.,"A realy good experience. Sold out in Norway, had to go to Sweden to get it.Worth the trip.",0
61,1,Yamazaki,"Good, not great, for price","Good, but not any better than the rest of the pack in the price range. There are in every good liquor store several scotches in the same price range, at least a couple of which will be better than the Yamazaki. That said, it is a good whisky, enjoyable to the nose and the palate. It lacks just a bit of fullness, however, necessary to move toward the front of the class.",1
62,1,Yamazaki,Excellent,Excellent Enjoyed it a lot  but it has become too expensive.,1
63,1,Yamazaki,"Decent, but not for its price range ","Simply doesn’t have the depth and range of flavor as most Japanese whiskies in the 75-125 price range. If you’re looking to try something new and have had all the others, it’s probably worth giving it a shot. But if you’re considering other Japanese whiskeys around 100, almost anything on that list would likely be more dynamic. ",1

65,1,Yamazaki,The best whisky I have ever tasted.,The best whisky I have ever tasted. My favorite by far.,0
66,1,Yamazaki,worth EVERY cent,"Recently was introduced to this beauty and I must say, it does not disappoint! I originally thought Id try it and move on, Now I make sure to keep it in my cabinets. Quickly became a favorite of mine after just a few glasses.",0
67,1,Yamazaki,Perf,Best,0
68,1,Yamazaki,Superb!,"Awesome! I wish it cost as much as it used to ($60-$70 USD circa 2015). The media and hype (maybe justified?) has brought the price much higher these days. Very similar taste to the 18, although a bit more rough but not by much. Wondering if it was worth it to purchase the Yamazaki 18....Very balanced and rich. Full body, rich flavors, hint of vanilla, floral, nuts, and a tinge of spice. I wish it was kept a secret before the ratings...",1
69,1,Yamazaki,"Beautiful, superb.....",I only pour a tot on special occasions... I'm sadly running out of the nectar !!!!,1

72,1,Yamazaki,must have,Excellent exotic whisky,0
73,1,Yamazaki,Is just the hype,"Gents, at this price? Think how many great 18, and 21 year old scotch can you get at this price range. I try this 12 and the reserve. Neither one impress me, so I'm out, at list of this one. ",2
74,1,Yamazaki,Expensive though,Nice ,0
75,1,Yamazaki,overrated,Japanese whiskies are overrated ,2
76,1,Yamazaki,OK at best,"In my opinion, this is overpriced and overrated. I found it very nutty, oily and oaky. I did not find tropical fruits. I found oranges but the nutty and oakiness just overpower it. ",2
77,1,Yamazaki,Delicious but price has sky rocketed ,"First, let me say that when handed this I was shocked as to how good it was.  It was full bodied and flavored and tasted deeper than the average many 15 year olds.  But the pricing model has made it not-affordable.  Just a few years ago this could be found in NY for $40 and in CA for $30.  Even in 2016, around $60 in NY - suddenly, the price has shot up and is selling at crazy numbers.  I can't imagine that the average scotch drinkers can afford this anymore and they won't be losing market share.  Which is too bad.  ",1
78,1,Yamazaki,A Must to have ,"I had it a taste of it recently during a stay in Hiroshima , brilliant Malt , I liked it's sweet palate ,soft fruits and the smoky taste . The price was good too at about 5€ a generous  one .",0
79,1,Yamazaki,Superb 12 yr old,Sampled it last month in a hotel in Kyoto at 500 yen a glass about £3.70 GBP (serious measure too !!) superb whisky and at an unbelievable price !,1

83,1,Yamazaki,"Good, not outstanding. Far too expensive.","Had a bottle of this a few years ago at a much more reasonable price and thought it was good.Now, I've been lucky enough to have been given another and thought I'd review it...If it cost the same as some standard issue Scottish 10-14 year old whiskies then I would say it's decent offering but for me it's no way near as good as the much more subtle yet elegantly satisfying Hakushu Distiller's Reserve. Good appealing nose, nice unimposing, sightly sweet flavour but slightly too much burn and nothing particularly interesting coming through.To me, it's overpriced fairly decent generic whisky.",1
84,1,Yamazaki,Senior John,Most beautiful whisky,0
85,1,Yamazaki,Yamazaki 12yr,Excellent and smooth whiskey.  Definitely one of my favorites. Wish one day I'll get a chance to try the 18yr & the sherry cask!!,0
86,1,Yamazaki,Yamazaki 12,"Japansk single malt som luktar citrus, blommig karaktär av det bättre slaget, sälta samt lätt doft av tropiska frukter.I överlag måste jag säga att jag blev ganska besviken med tanke på vad jag tyckte om distiller’s reserve så förväntningarna var höga men helt klart godkänd doft i alla fall! (den här luktar mer åt det maltiga hållet)Smak: Blev chokad över hur spritig den var, inte det värsta jag känt men hade räknat med noll?! Kryddig i smaken och en ganska god eftersmak av tropiska frukter som dör av ganska snabbt. Blir diss på denna!",0
87,1,Yamazaki,It's sold out...... Says it all!!,Really is excellent. My wife searched for a bottle for me for quite some time before finally getting a bottle from Master of Malt. It's not in stock often and is hard to get any where else. There is a reason for that. Get a bottle when you can you won't be disappointed!!!!,0
88,1,Yamazaki,Rated this time,"Sorry, forgot to include the rating in my first review. Tasted this at the distillery along with several Hakushu and the Yamazaki 18 and 35 year (and the of the dial Sherry Cask, which I did see for sale at several thousand dollars the bottle). The Yamazaki 12 year is the best single I can afford, not quite the complete package that the 18 year is. Some of my companions preferred The Hakushu 12 year. Even the distillery is no longer selling these, but I tracked some of both down in a larger outlet in Kyoto (who also had the aforementioned bottle of Sherry Cask), so worth searching if you want some at less than museum exhibit prices.",1
89,1,Yamazaki,One of the best,"Visited the Yamazaki distillery, tried a number of offerings including 35 year and the amazing Sherry cask. The 12 year is not quite the complete package that the 18 year is, but the best single malt I can afford. BTW at the time of writing you could no longer get the 12 year, even at the distillery, but I tracked down a few bottles at a larger outlet in Kyoto at a price I was ok with, brought them home along with a couple of The Hakushu 12 year, that some of my fellow tasters at the distillery felt was superior. Will do a bit of sampling once I'm over the jet lag.",1
90,1,Yamazaki,Craig ,Received as a birthday gift from my wife and I must say it is truly amazing one of the best i have tried ,0
91,1,Yamazaki,Dry and smoky,"I've had a chance to try a number of Suntory whiskies, Yamazaki 18 and 12 years old being among them, and, reluctantly, I have to say most of their expressions feature a slightly smoky palate with an incredibly oaky and dry finish. I had been expecting a more profound experience, but having tasted the 12 year old Yamazaki, I'm not sure it is capable of giving decent, oaky Scottish malts a run for their money. The price tag certainly makes me lean more towards bottlings such as the 12 YO Edradour or the 12 YO Cardhu.",1
92,1,Yamazaki,The best drink i ever tried.,"The best, mmm love it, smooth, delicious, with charakter.",0
93,1,Yamazaki,Amazing ,"This is truly a treat! Nose is off the charts.  Fruit,  caramel.  Flavor is just as amazing.  A must have. ",0
94,1,Yamazaki,Superb. ,This is superb. Slowing going missing in the market thus high price. One of the best single malt.  It is a vintage.,0
95,1,Yamazaki,Interesting whisky,"Nose: fruit, figs, almond, tropical fruitsTaste: subtle spice, Sweet, a tiny bite. Finish : medium & warmingAverage in my humble opinion since it's a very expensive comparatively ",1
96,1,Yamazaki,Not bad at all,Was worth it when I bought it for $60 US but at over $100 its tough to say that its worth it.  But Yamazaki is through the roof so that's about right.,1
97,1,Yamazaki,"I LOVED the distiller's reserve, this was a disappointment!","This is almost double the price than distiller's reserve and you just have a touch of the good tastes that the reserve got. You feel the alcohol way to much, it's not even close to it's little brother!",2
98,1,Yamazaki,Manoj Ramchandani  ,Fabulous single malt like music to your mind n soul smooth n delicious prefer it to the Yamazaki 18 years ,0
99,1,Yamazaki,Excellent,This is a very tasty whisky and is very smooth.  It is easy to drink and its aroma is delicate and lovely.  For those who are interested in a nice whisky that anyone can drink try this one.  ,0
100,1,Yamazaki,The Seeker reviews Yamazaki 12 Year Old. ,An absolutely mouth watering nose of creamy nuttiness and fruit medley. This carries on wonderfully onto the palate with a clear Bourbon influence which is also obvious on the nose. A lingering fruit and oaky finish wraps things up perfectly. There's no smoke or peat just fruit and spice akin to the aforementioned Bourbons it so closely resembles. This is a textbook Japanese Single Malt. The only downside is the price which is way too steep at present. Luckily I had mine for just £35 from a good friend which is an absolute steal. ,1
101,1,Yamazaki,Very good,"First off I'll say that I found this much cheaper than others on here so I went in to to it a lot more open minded and with lower expectations. This whisky is fantastic. The nose is very sweet, with strong vanilla coming through. It is a very light whisky, and really shines neat. The finish is strongly reminiscent of bourbon, reminding me of Blantons more than anything else. Overall if you can find this for a good price, it is definitely worth adding to your collection. ",0
102,1,Yamazaki,Good but hype. Carzy price.,"It was a good drink but I paid for fiddich 21, livet 18, macca 18, signet. get my point. hype and overrated is getting the price to increase. Crazy price. If can cut price by 30 % would have been 5 stars.",1
103,1,Yamazaki,Manoj Ramchandani ,Super smooth absolutely relaxing with sweet taste just got a bottle from Barcelona airport am treasuring it as not in stock must buy n must try stunning ,0
105,1,Yamazaki,"Pretty good, but the hype for Japanese whisky is crazy","Quite enjoyed it, but like others have said for the price it's nothing special. Depressingly I found a bottle in my local alcohol shop in Portugal...€179 or roughly £140!!! I wonder when this hype over Japanese whisky will end?",1
106,1,Yamazaki,Love Bill Fucking Murry,This is training wheels for Scotch.   ,1
107,1,Yamazaki,Excellent,"Very smooth, well balanced, & tasty!",0
108,1,Yamazaki,htpait@gmail.com,"Dropped in one small ice cube, swirreled for several seconds and removed the ice cube. The smell of ripe bananas exploded and the finish reminded me of artichoke petals dipped in butter.Lovely!",0
109,1,Yamazaki,mr s hopkins,a whiskey to savour a very good flavour profile,0
110,1,Yamazaki,Overrated and overpriced.,"Acquired this after all hoopla exploded about Suntory's Yamazaki (mainly due to the Sherry cask version). I generally drink single-malt Scotch and straight Bourbon and, mainly because I am research before you buy person, I have generally had a wonderful journey through the world of whisky. I can honestly say, this was the first time I have felt let-down by a single malt. It's not that it's bad, it has an interesting and quite unique nose (which I think the MoM tasting notes are pretty on point about, though banana is the tropical fruit I think they are talking about) and the body is pretty full and substantial. That said, it isn't all that engaging and it feels muddled, with that banana stomping all over the short hints of sherry and citrus in the palate. That said, if you find the flavor profile interesting (and a lot of people do), then it would be easy to recommend at 40-50 dollars.Which brings us to price: even if I loved the profile, the execution is too muddled and fuzzy (almost blended-malt like) to be even remotely worth 80-100 dollars they are now charging for the 12. At 40 bucks it'd be reasonable, at 80+ it's just plain overpriced.",2
111,1,Yamazaki,Delicious ,Me and my boyfriend have Been looking all over for this stuff..He loves this ...finally found a vendor I'm Miami.. So I'm driving down there from coconut creek tomorrow to get it. I will get him some for Christmas.,0
112,1,Yamazaki,"Smooth, rich, tasty mmmm..","The best whisky i've tried. My rank is 1 pl is yamazaki, 2nd glenlivet12, 3rd is chivas regal 12",0
113,1,Yamazaki,Beautiful,Just so smooth. Such a shame it's so hard to find these days.,1
114,1,Yamazaki,Very nice but......,"tried a bottle I recently bought from m,Chester airport , I found it quite smooth and it seemed taste differently on each  taste  but I was disappointed when it had gone although I would be happy to buy @ 40-50 quid anything more  I think I would prefer a lagavullin 16 which  I thought was a touch smoother .",1
115,1,Yamazaki,Totally overrated,"I have tried a lot of Japanese whiskies and this one is totally overrated i have to say. It is unfocused, to much taste of alcohol and you get the impression it is not 12 years old at all. There are some nice fruity and spicy notes but nothing comes together the way it should be in a 12 yo. If you wish to explore Japanese whisky go with Nikka taketsuru 17 or Hibiki 17. They are very different from this one but much better and much more well rounded. No point in spending so much money when you can get a good glenmorangie for half or 2/3s of the price. The 18yo is very interesting on the other hand, a bit pricy though.",2
116,1,Yamazaki,Intensifed ,"Looks like Scotch Whisky, smells like it, tastes like it, but...all characteristics have been elevated a notch.  I found it to be more intense in every category.  I really like it.",0
117,1,Yamazaki,Awesome,This is the most enjoyable single malt I have ever had. Why can't I find it anywhere now???,0
118,1,Yamazaki,Unique and unlike American scotch or Irish ,Im a single malt scotch junkie through and through.  this whiskey is in a different category.  and I dig it.  the color is nice med light Amber and it leaves oily trails on the glass if you swirl it.  the nose is citrus through and through with notes of a sweeter fruit.  you'd almost expect it to be a sugary drink from the nose.  the mouthfeel is surprisingly dry which I like.  the finish is citrus.  and tart and bitter and I mean that as a compliment.  the flavor is subtle enough that if you enjoy it with different foods you might pick up different notes and flavors that you didn't notice before.  my final verdict though is biased.  as a stand alone whiskey I still prefer the unique taste of a peated scotch.  but I've had peated scotch I like less than this excellent whiskey.  cheers,0
119,1,Yamazaki,Yamazaki 12 year old. ,"Had a sip in a bar and was hooked. expensive and difficult to find in the Philippines. found a dealer selling at equivalent of £65 and grabbed 2 bottles. I had the fortune of going to Jspan a few weeks later. Price  there was equivalent to £42. I grabbed another one, the last one. even in Japan, they are hard to come by. I am going back in October and will probably get 2 or 3 more. ",1
120,1,Yamazaki,best 12yr  out there ,"Has a sweet flavor.  This whiskey is more complex than any 12yr you can find. Step it up Scotland, you are falling behind ",1
121,1,Yamazaki,Very good,tried this today on one bar. Very good End up buying for my friends as well.Nice smell and tasteLoved it ,0
122,1,Yamazaki,Pretty Good,"I am just enjoying a first sip of this and think it is pretty good. I would say that I enjoy an 18 Glenfiddich, or even The Glenlivet 12...even a Macallan for the price. Will definitely try more Japanese Whisky, but I wouldn't say I am going to get another bottle of this stuff again.It's good, but it leaves me wanting more after each sip.",1
123,1,Yamazaki,Not bad,"Tried this one a couple of years ago and just didn't ""get it"".  Nice whisky for sure, but tasted like a fairly standard/light Highland malt.  Nothing for peat-heads obviously, but very understated generally.  A good honest malt but not in a hurry to buy one even when it cost £35.",1
124,1,Yamazaki,Scots can´t compete.,This is absolutely World class! It just couldent be better. Try it and enjoy Japanese perfection.If I were a Scot I´ll be worried....,0

130,1,Yamazaki,Tastes like Chocolate,"We ate chocolate right before tasting this. So, we didn't get much citrus, we mostly got chocolate.",1
131,1,Yamazaki,Very nice,"Smooth and well rounded.  Alcohol content is there but not over whelming.  First shot OTR,  but i am getting a little butterscotch on the back end.  I have spent 6 months with JW Platinum, this is parallel or a little finer.  Who would have thought ""Booze Traveler"" would accomplish anything?  Well it has.  Nice job to the show and especially the distillery.",0
132,1,Yamazaki,Thumbs up,You guys weren't joking about the tropical notes... Bang on the money with that tasting note. ,1
133,1,Yamazaki,Amazing whisky even if you don't like Scotland Scotch.,"first, I don't like the taste of Scotland scotch.   Yamazaki has a flavor all its own.  My daughter is in JET (Japanese assistant English teacher).  She bought me home a bottle for Christmas since all her Japanese friends love it.  Count me among them.  Totally unique flavor, in no way scotch like.  Fabulous taste, 2 shots = a nice buzz. She's definitely got to send me some more.  If you haven't tasted this you're in for a big surprise.  Who would have thought that anything besides good sake would come out of JApan ?",0
134,1,Yamazaki,Delectable,"I've been wanting to try this for a while after tasting their Hibiki blend (which is delicious btw). Everywhere seems to be sold out or too expensive. I recently found three bottles in my local Tesco Metro for £40 a pop. I bought one, tried it, loved it and went straight back to buy the other two.",0
135,1,Yamazaki,Spoiled brat,"Lucky me, my brothers brother in law cracked open a Yamazaki he picked up in Tokyo on x'mas eve.  I was shocked after my first sip. There was no biting taste, very tasty and fruity with a long spicy finish.  I searched all over Chicago and the answer was the same, out of stock since before Thanksgiving thanks to all the publicity.  On a lark, I visited my neighborhood dram shop and they had it in stock.  More surprising was the actual price, 30-50% below internet price.  Needless to say I happily bought their entire stock and that of their sister store in the suburbs.  ",0
136,1,Yamazaki,Try before You Die,"there aren't words to describe this whisky. complex but smooth, classy yet down to earth, beautiful and tasty. all I could think of was this really cute girl next door that we grew up with. very pretty yet smart and well grounded. if you call yourself a single malt whisky drinker, then you better find a bottle yesterday. I can't say enough about this amazing dram. someone here said stock up, and I agree because prices on this whisky will only go up. the easiest 10 rating I have given. ",0
137,1,Yamazaki,Suntory Unequaled,"Living in Tokyo, I became a fan of Suntory Scotch for its smoothness and non-biting flavor. Yamazaki was not marketed then and I can only go by my favorite Suntory Reserve which was considered the distillery's premier brand. I did not realize Suntory whiskeys were available in the U.S. and bought an equally good substitute that comes closest to it : Chivas Regal. Since Suntory acquired Jim Beam, they are readily available and I bought a bottle last week.  An amazing whiskey. ",0
138,1,Yamazaki,Whisky with class and Taste,I tried the Yamazaki 12 year old yesterday .The Blend is so wonderful and the taste savours in your mouth all the while.Very Light and simply beautiful for an enjoiable evening..Great Invention...,0
139,1,Yamazaki,Crazy mature,"Totally agree with the reviewer saying it could pass for an 18.  I'm *currently* sipping it right next to an Aberlour 18 at double the price and it's almost identical (*slightly* more light-white-fruit and less heavy-red-fruit than the Aberlour in flavor profile, but only slightly; maturity feels identical).  I've got a Balvenie 12 nearby and it's significantly more rough and less flavorful, yet more expensive than the Yamazaki.",1

143,1,Yamazaki,The best I have ever tasted,"As the title says, this is a wonderful malt whisky. I was surprised and disappointed when my wife bought me a bottle, until that is I tasted it. If you like whisky, you are going to love this.",0

146,1,Yamazaki,ERII,"I love it, hè is very soft, has his own taste and is one of THE greatest whisky's.",0
147,1,Yamazaki,Flavorful,"There's absolutely nothing bad I can say about this one except it's maybe *too* flavorful.  But even that...just marginally so.  It *slightly* tastes more aperitif than a whisky should IMO, but maybe that's the future.  The chocolate vaguely reminds me of the Bushmills 21 I once had, but more subtle.  Me, I'll still take something a bit more malty like a Glen Grant or Old Pulteney.  But this is still very good and worth a try.",0
148,1,Yamazaki,Fantastic,"Loved it. Simple as that. Only one small negative, a bottle of malt is enjoyed before it is opened, so please don't put a cheap arse plastic top on it! This bottle is way too good and should have a cork to get that pop from opening.",1
149,1,Yamazaki,I love it,but i'm in no position for professional tasting notes. But is there anyone but me that get alittle maple hint on the nose?,1
150,1,Yamazaki,RRR,"I can honestly say ""I have never tasted a better malt than this 12year old"".I've tasted a lot of whisky's in the last 40 years, some harsher, some not so harsh, Although not a connoisseur I know what I like,  and this is it... ",0

153,1,Yamazaki,Needs a bit of time,"I bought this bottle a long time ago for a party, freshly opened i found this to taste very odd, it had a strong sweetness and taste of caramel and about an equally strong bitter tannin taste and this yielded some sort of flat taste curve of sorts. It didn't linger and you was left with just this dry tannin taste.Now, however, it has been in the shelf for a few months at about 70% of content left and i tried this again last night and i must say i was very positively surprised, It have developed a very nice round sweet taste with some sort of vanilla mixed with some fruity jelly candy tastes and the nose felt very developed with first having very much orange peel -citrus smell where after the same jelly candy smell came about after a while.Definitely one of my favorites now!",0

160,1,Yamazaki,eye opener,"This was the first whisky that opened my eyes to the wonderful world of single malts. Before this, I was in the obscure world of blends and the occasional Glenlivet and Glenfiddich 12. I've never looked back ever since.

164,1,Yamazaki,Alcoholic,I purchase one just for tge fun of it because its japanese. But with all honesty this is one of those whisky thats hard not to RECOMEND who likes a fine drink. i mean very very fine whisky. You can call me biased but the yamazaki is one of the best whisky i ever tasted.,0
167,1,Yamazaki,One of the best,I was given a bottle of this for my birthday last week and I must say it it probably amongst the best malts I have EVER had the pleasure to enjoy.Get over your parochial prejudice and give it a try . . . you won't be disappointed.,0
168,1,Yamazaki,Excellent but a bit sweet,"Smooth is the word. And adding water,  is a must to bring out the smells and taste. I recommend about 30-40% which is a tad more than for most.The only objection is that it is a whisky intended for the broad audience and so the experience is a bit, well average. Then again my taste is for the somewhat more smokey and with a tad more oomph. It is a bit on the sweet side in my view. Then again you cannot go wrong serving Yamazaki to your guests after your finer dinner though.",0
169,1,Yamazaki,Loved it,"I picked up a bottle of this because it looked different.  Couldn't have been happier I did!  I will say (from my experience), adding a drop of water really adds to this.  It settles it down and allows the smells and taste to develop.  Try it and let me know!",0

171,1,Yamazaki,Mixed feelings,"I had a lot of expectations from this whisky, my gf got me a bottle for Christmas,it turned out I was mostly disappointed. The nose is really great,and there are some interesting notes but I found the palate very unrefined and with poor balance. A rough aftertaste that I did not appreciate at all.

183,1,Yamazaki,Love this whiskey.,"Phenomenal!  A great whiskey for the price.  I like it as much as the Yamazaki 18, but it is quite a bit cheaper.  Buy a bottle and you will know why the Japanese whiskeys are doing so well at international awards.  Just so I don't sound biased towards Japanese whiskeys, I am drinking a dram of Highland Park 18 right now and enjoying it thoroughly.",0
286,0,Yamazaki,My God. ,"There's not much to say. I've never tasted a whisky like this. To be honest, at first I was skeptical. The nose was familiar, the mouthfeel familiar. The taste familiar. But the finish. Oh. My. God. Not one single whisky I've experienced is even remotely Close to the complexity and longevity of the finish found in this gem. Raisin, chocolate, almond, all working their way from deep at the back of your tongue, and slowly to the front, with a never ending evolution of experience. I count at least 1-2 minutes of altering experiences!I've sadly never owned a bottle, and only experienced it as a single nip. But that nip was heavenly. ",1
287,0,Yamazaki,Very much like Macallan 18,"I got a 3cl sample of this and just tried it.  This is so much like Magellan 18 I couldn't believe it!  The Yamazaki 18 is also sherried, but lighter sherry and slightly sweet compared to the Yamazaki Sherry Cask.  The Macallan 18, in comparison, has a deeper sherry flavor, likely due to the fact that it is a true Speyside character to balance.  The Sherry cask has a slightly more complex sherry nuance compared to Macallan 18, but they are so much alike it may be challenging to decipher the two in a blind taste test.I'm glad I had a chance to try it, as the novelty of being best whiskey that year in Murray's whiskey bible.  It is the best example of a sherried whiskey........somewhere between Macallan 18 and Ardbeg Dark Cove (a more heavily sherried islay), more closer to the former than the latter.",0

331,0,Yamazaki,Really good whisky but not amazing,"This whisky is very good but not amazing, scores 88 points in my opinion.  Not really worth the price of £200 as you can get some sherried beauties that score 90-95 for this price or less.  As for the second market price - don't even go there.  To the below...........I have tasted this whisky and there are many substitutes, I don't even have time to list them all right now so no need for the love-in with Suntory.  ",1
332,0,Yamazaki,Conclusion,"there is a reason why this whisky is in high demand, it's not because it's highly rated in some review, it's because if you have tasted this whisky, you will realize that there are absolutely no substitutes. Even if there were, none of you will be posting all these negative remarks and showing how ugly you truly are.Yes, it's uncool for Suntory to make small batches every year, but have you thought that maybe that reason is because they are perfectionist? They won't release mediocre whisky into the market just to make money, especially since their cost price to people like MoM is as per the norm. All I'm saying is, if there's a high demand for a product, be prepared to pay for it, if you can't afford it, go drink something else. If there's a substitute for it, go buy that instead and stop complaining that this is just another overrated whisky. I've tried it and it's the best whisky I've ever tasted. Even if you think I'm wrong, taste is all personal, not general.  Thank you MoM for giving us a chance to own this bottle at a fair price. ",0
333,0,Yamazaki,Response to shame on you alone ,"I have plenty of respect for whisky 'drinkers' (although £200 for a NAS is frankly ridiculous). My post called foul on the 'investors', I thought that much was clear? This is the whisky equivalent of all those empty London flats, nothing but safety deposit boxes for the super rich. I have no problem calling this out for what it is. If you get a bottle and drink it, fair play. But whisky should be drunk. I've met Shinji personally and I wonder if it would sadden him that much of this expression, which I'm certain he has invested time and care in, will never be drunk. Investors are a reality of the secondary market but this frenzy is an affront. Sic transit gloria mundi! ",1

An unseemly scramble through the slimy detritus of human greed and obsession. £200 for a NAS whisky to be flipped for £2000 and then sat in a display cabinet, never to be drunk, as much use as a pair of deer antlers up on the wall. Yup, this is what it's come to.  I spit in all your shameless faces.The retailers should start selling their wares in unsealed screw cap bottles to ensure the contents are simply drunk. The ""collectors"" (read investors) should take stock of what they're actually doing and accept this is not about whisky, it's just capitalist fetishism.",2

I wouldn't attempt to purchase a bottle from a German/Dutch/French website. If bottles are allocated to a country, they should stay there. Also, auctions are contemptible. ",1
370,0,Yamazaki,"@ @""Japanese Whisky""","The issue is not charity and donating in general.The issue is (a) by saying proceeds (above RRP) go to charity it automatically implies there's gonna be a bidding war. The price will go way up there where ordinary folks like you and I won't even stand a chance to buy and (b) I think you got it wrong. You say ""MoM give the excess to charity so they're not accused of profiteering.""Way up there in the page is says - ""(where anything over RRP will be donated to charity)""Where do you think this ""over RRP"" comes from?Where do you see MoM saying they'll put money from their pocket?It's their customers' pocket...Like many people mentioned below. Everyone chooses to donate to the charity of their choice.As for UK addresses I can only assume the comments that oppose to this are from outside the UK? Surely.MoM is UK based and their profits for the most part come from UK customers. Not from international sales.This coupled with the fact that there is only a handful of bottles allocated within the UK (most of which are already reserved for rich clientele and high end bars) I don't see what's unfair about it.If the US gets its allocation of bottles why should a folk from the states have a chance to buy from the UK site? Any UK site for that matter.",1
371,0,Yamazaki,Good work,"This is the only honest way of getting to taste this.  What other ways do retailers have of getting this to us drinkers.  If you don’t like it, you have very little choice.Either ignore the hype and sit it out.Wait to see if a bottle arrives on an auction site and put the hammer price in the pocket of the auction site or that of someone looking to make a quick profit.There are plenty of other £200 bottles that may be better.The hype around this is only based on the 2013 bottle and the unusual hype and increasing price of Japan Whisky anyway.I for one want to taste it, purely because I want to see the difference between the bottles I can afford/buy and those that are supposed to the best in the world.  I cant afford a bottle but ill certainly be on the look out for a 3cl sample.Good luck to everyone.",1

THAT is how the real world works!  And as for good causes etc Give me a break.  I walked 970 miles in 35 degree heat last year for charity.  Three years before that I did the West Highland Way.  I also pay online to WWF.  I don't need dictated too by anyone else about giving to some unspecified charity when making an online purchase!

382,0,Yamazaki,UK Buyers Only,"After the BTAC fiasco last year, there's no perfect way of allocating these highly sought after bottles, and while it pains me to see UK retailers following the American lottery system, I think this is the best way to allocate bottles, and I commend MoM for taking this step. Having said that, I agree entirely with the comment below - please MoM, if at all possible under EU trade laws restrict the lottery to UK buyers only. There is a huge amount of global demand for this whisky and as one of the most acclaimed online retailers in the world, there will be a huge interest for places in the lottery from all corners of the globe. If I had to guess, I think there will be less than 10 bottles available to the general public to buy in the UK once VIP customers, bars and hotels have received their priority allocation, and if this is the case, I think wherever possible, UK retailers should try to ensure British customers are given priority over international customers.",1

They're over 3000 yen if you can even manage to find them now.  There's really something unique about the way they marry aged malt and grain whiskies and then further age the mixture in wood.  It sets this whisky apart.  The closest thing I've found to compare this to is the Cutty Sark Prohibition.  But it's not really in the same class.

785,2,Nikka,"Give it some time, give it some water","First expression of this whisky for me was horrible, I was thinking that something must had gone wrong... And something did, the way I drank it.This beverage requires some time, be very cautions with water as you can overdrown this easily while trying to down its alcohol content. Give it a spoon of water & wait, and after 10 minutes, try it out slowly, let your nose and mouth to get accustomed to alcohol, and you would discover its rich taste.Very interesting experience, but unfortunately has a Japan whisky price, which are a little bit overpriced.",1
786,2,Nikka,"Great!  And difficult to ""peg"" into a category","I first tasted this at the Whisky Show at Old Billingsgate in 2016.  Was ""spot on"" with nose, flavor, and aftertaste.  Bought one bottle, and drank it so fast, I missed the nuances.  Ordered two more, and will give you a more thorough review in two weeks.  Overall, an enormously strong, complex, and flavorful whisky, with plenty of fruitiness, and totally irresistible. ",0
787,2,Nikka,What a whisky!!,"BUY this whisky, its incredible value for money. Im a total novice in whisky, but here are my notes! Nose: Elegant fruits like in a fruit salat, leaning more towards citrus fruits/orange peel. Slightly sweet and also nutty, almonds. Mouth: Fruits follow through, then come almonds/nuts and a hint of caramel. At the end a little dry and rather oaky! ",0
788,2,Nikka,Very Good,"My 2nd Japanese, after Hibiki 12, and I'm very impressed, again!Agree with poster below - this is thick!  Wonderfully so.  Lots of tropical fruit, spice and almost buttery on the palate.  Lovely mouth-feel and a long sweet syrupy finish with a touch of wood spice dryness.    I like a few drops of water in this but it can be drunk without no problem.  Considering rising prices this is an excellent value whisky from Japan!  Recommended.",0
789,2,Nikka,Delicious and surprising,"It tastes almost ""thick"" - wonderful and unexpected. Not at all like a Scotch, but even more different than any Bourbon. Enormous character.",0
790,2,Nikka,Stunning,Not much more to say really but you have to try this what a whisky and a real good price,0
791,2,Nikka,Where else would it come from?,"If you have not tried it,just BUY SOME.",0
792,2,Nikka,facebook.com/maltmondays - my online whisky blog,"@maltmondaysThe Nose. Is predictably strong, a hard hit of alcohol, however once your nose adjusts the complexity does cut through, intense hits of brown sugar, rum & raisins. Fruit plays a big part in the nature of this whisky. The nose has a great mix of spice and fruit, think a whole orange poked with star anise before placing in your winter mulled wine pot!  The Taste. Has all the traits the nose implies, caramelized cooked fruits, Toffee, Sticky, buttery-ness on the tongue. That welcome spice hits back too, it’s a 5-spice and Asian cuisine style heat. This is a big mouthful, don’t be intimidated by the strength, let it linger until you get that beautiful mouthful of Christmas pudding and warm winter desserts.   The Finish. Thankfully this does the taste justice, long, smooth and very warming. There’s some Oak maturity too which is a nice contrast to the Fruit. Ginger and cinnamon hints arise after a few seconds and they are very welcome! The rich spice stays long after you’ve had a few drams and walked away from this drop. Something I found hard to do.

793,2,Nikka,Full body,"Full body, spicy finish",1
794,2,Nikka,Wow!,"Wish I knew about this before. My first whisky from Japan, and wow! What a surprise, had it in a sushi bar after dessert.Now, I am not that much of an expert in these matters, but this is one of those drams that could easily be mistaken for a malt and given that appropriate score. Try it out. Well worth it.",0
795,2,Nikka,Oak!,Slight oak? Really? This smells strong oak. Almost like a mix between a bourbon and rum.,1
796,2,Nikka,"Wow, I was not expecting this","First tried Nikka last year, the first taste was a pleasant surprise. I have never been able to describe the taste of Whisky in the way many experts have done, however flowers and many other fragrance's are evident together with a slight oak. It's one to savour. ",0
797,2,Nikka,You should try it.,"This really is amazing stuff. I've paid three times the price for whisky that wasn't this good. If all whisky was free, i'f give it a 9/10, but since price is a factor for most of us, I'll give it a 10/10. You can't go wrong with this one. Once again the MOM tasting notes are dead on. I will buy more when this bottle is gone. ",0
798,2,Nikka,Marko,Absolutely stunning. I got this one as a present from my friends from Finland. I am amazed how this whiskey combines strength and smoothness. Excellent excellent excellent.  ,0
799,2,Nikka,Caramel toffee blanket,It's sharp and cuddly at the same time. ,1
800,2,Nikka,Nikka!!!,"The bottle...oh the bottle!! Expect to loose a few drops as the bottle is not designed for an easy pour!Now, the taste; first sniff, seemed a little intense, factor in it's a high %% drop and it's expected. Definitely under tones of vanilla and citrus, I found it a little harsh, but I'm coming from 21yr Royal Salute - which is very smooth!I'm taking one the gents previous post advise and let it breath for 20....no doubt I'll be raving afterwards 😉👍",0
801,2,Nikka,A good strong cask strength.,A very delicate whisky; some caramel and honey overtones. I don't seem to love it as much as others but it's still enjoyable. Good price point too and excellent stand out packaging.,0
802,2,Nikka,I LOVE JAPAN....,"Just try it, IF one doesn't like this, well, Mahayana whiskey in't your thing.....",0
803,2,Nikka,Sweaper ,A god and strong taste wonderful aftertaste whit a loong and Smoth taste of citrus the fruity flavor comes when you role the beverge rolls over your pallet 👍But ....... Add some water after your delight and feel the smoothnes ,0
804,2,Nikka,Tastes familiar,"Very pleasant flavour, reminds me of johnnie walker black but better. ",0
805,2,Nikka,Beautiful,This is one of the nicest whiskys have had. Dangerously drinkable! I hosted a whisky eve and so purchased this to provide a lighter example for my guests. Not a drop was left. Beautifully fruity and deliciously smooth. Shame it only comes in 50cl.,0
806,2,Nikka,Japanese perfection,Japanese in one Bottle. Love IT,0
807,2,Nikka,Nikka from barrel,Friend gave good tasting of this japanese whiskey. I would say it tasted industrial at first. But aftertaste was quite good. Not the best one but neither the worst. Wouldn't buy it myself.,1
808,2,Nikka,A real treat,A real treat this little beauty. It's not often a blended whisky takes your breath away but this is a real all guns blazing belter of a find. Taste grabs hold of you and gives you a beautiful warm hug and a toffee kiss before tucking you in at night.This won't stay in my cupboard very long.,0
809,2,Nikka,Just grrat,Briljant taste,0
810,2,Nikka,Remarkably good,Given the price that this retails at this is fantastic and would hold its own against most. Loved it. Smooth. Lots of caramel and toffee flavours. ,0
811,2,Nikka,First time Japanese and really Impressed ,"This was the only decent Japanese whiskey with a decent price in my location. So tried this. I am glad I did buy this one. It's one of a kind. Initial notes of caramel, toffee and at the back the alcohol and smoke hits you in a good way. It's something unique that I have not tasted in any other whiskey. Needs teaspoon of water to open it up and be a little bit more mellow The bottle although looks nice is a pain to pour the whiskey. You lose some drops trying to pour to a glass. Too bad considering this is a small bottle and I don't like to waste a single drop. ",0
812,2,Nikka,Virginal experience,"Tried this whisky for the first time tonight and what a triumph!  Caramel, yes, and smoothness in great measure. I hadn't tried Japanese whisky before but consider me hooked.  I'm almost tempted to go downstairs for another sipped shot but might have to plump for sleep.  Well done, Tokyo.",0
813,2,Nikka,Stunning,Well spent money!,0
814,2,Nikka,Fantastic,Fantastic,0
815,2,Nikka,Great!!,"Having been a Single Malt drink for a while now, I recently spotted this and felt the urge to try it, The description is perfect its very sweet and has a Long Warming after that lasts and is a delight, I am very impressed with this Blended dram from the far east, I have only had 2 small drinks but i am very impressed,  The package is nice and the bottling is pretty cool.Would Recommend ",0
816,2,Nikka,Why Not!! Nikka Whiskey,Let it rest and then enjoy.. This whiskey kicks many more expensive bottles out of the park... If you haven't tried it yet then my question to you is simple... Why Not!!,0
817,2,Nikka,Opening it up,"For me, this is one of the very best blended whisky ever produced. Over the years blended whiskies have improved so much and this is a fine example of that. It's a complex whisky that opens up beautifully with around 15ml of water (or 1 small ice cube) for the 50ml double - it also helps because of the alcohol content. It really is like opening a hidden box of flavours within the drink. Really do love this whisky, very delicious. It's a 4 out 5 simply because in the grand scheme of things it can never quite make it to the summit, it's stuck at base camp 4... very commendable just not quite the real McCoy. ",0
818,2,Nikka,Horrible,I didn't like it. Nothing against a Whisky from Scotland or Ireland...,2
819,2,Nikka,Dtac_se,Wonderful dram!,0
820,2,Nikka,Nikka,Dont need to say something about this one..,1
821,2,Nikka,I love this!,Thank you!,1
822,2,Nikka,"Outstanding, sweet, complex, smooth, amazing","I was absolutely shocked by this one. initially i got a burbon-esque nose off it, very sweet, slightly oily. In the mouth its fantastically fruity with a hint of malt, and a good kick of alchol but without killing off any of the flavour. Sweet apple, toffee, some red berries and a little biscuit malt are the dominant flavours, along with subtle vanilla and a hint of citrus.Vanilla and chocolate comes through in the finish along with the berries. Its almost like a delicious juicy chocolate and berry cake!I cannot wait to get a bottle of this for myself, but I'm also nervous that it wont even last one sitting!",0
823,2,Nikka,"Abaot the ""nikka from the barrel"" ","It was my first encounter with any whiskies from Japan. Pleasant surprise. I have to confess I am a believer with the isley, but I found this good! G.Róna",0
824,2,Nikka,Not bad,"Am no expert. For me, whisky is either nice or disgusting. This falls into the former. It doesn't make me screw my face up as it's smooth on the palate and it's a warm and comforting drink. Nice.",0
825,2,Nikka,Pleasantly surprised!,Was given a sample of whiskey during a shopping trip and fell in love immediately. Bought a Nikka Whiskey From The Barrel and one of the Pure Malt. Just opened the whiskey from the barrel and love it. So much more complex than I expected. Is it time for another yet?:),0
826,2,Nikka,Astonishing depth for a blend,"Picked it up at the duty free yesterday and having the first drink. First up, the bottle is brilliant even though it's only .5l, it reminds me of moonshine jars.When you open the bottle, the alcohol overpowers the nose, so you've got to let it breathe.Add a few drops of water to the glass, let it swirl for a few minutes before the first sip. The nose then feels a lot like a good bourbon. The first sip is smoky, even herbal, almost like an Islay. Bourbon and vanilla in the background, but traces, only traces. Whisky for the darkest winter night. The finish is decently long, astringent, almost like pine and menthol. Touch of woodyness. That was 15 minutes ago. Now it seems to have smoothed with the flavor profile reversed. Bourbon, toffee, vanila, a touch of fruits (not as much as a Speyside) to the fore, the smokyness comes through in the background. The finish is clovery.This is one of those whiskys that will give you a different experience as you work your way down the bottle. Absolute gem, brilliant structure and depth for a high ABV, and to think its a blend. Scotch blends can eat their hearts out - Black Dog and Jonny Walkers ain't got nothing on this one. As good as a top single malt. One word - brilliant.",0
827,2,Nikka,Great Value and Flavors,During these dark times of high prices and low availability of Japanese whiskies in general this is a great bang for the buck. Offers some strong intense flavors that can be enjoyed neat but can be further opened up and savored with the addition of time and bit of water. ,0
828,2,Nikka,nikka from the barrel,"my first Japanese dram.very fine ,complex ,much fruit ,high alcohol. would like to know the agegeorg mikula",0

831,2,Nikka,Very strong,A very nice offering from Nikka,0
832,2,Nikka,Amazing Whisky,"While this whisky isn't cheap, it makes up for it with a wonderful deep flavour. Very little burn too, given the ABV. Fantastic stuff.",0
833,2,Nikka,Simpy amazing...,This time I bought two bottles :) ,1
834,2,Nikka,"Pour, sniff, allow to breathe. Sniff, drink, enjoy, repeat.","This is my first venture into japanese juice so I did not know what to expect. As a matter of fact, I wasn't even after japanese. I was after an Aberlour A'Bunadh 60 caliber but my go-to danish/german bordershop was out (same shop where I got the Balvenie 16y peated cask. Yum yum).It's a 51.4 caliber blend as most might already know.From the bottle into the GlenCairne: Quite a bit alcohol in the nose, which is no surprice due the the number printet at the bottle. So it has to rest for while. Then nice stuff rise from the glass. I get cinnamon and plums and orange. Christmas is in my nose. As the initial alcohol wears off, a pleasant sweetness adds to the nose. My first thought was candyfloss so now I get that every time. Smoke is completely absent.Sipping it, the surprise does start: I'd expect quite a tickling on the lips and tongue from the high percentage, but it's gentle and caressing and doesn't burn at all. It's fruit on the palate along with a more peppery spiciness. A very fullbodied taste that completely fills my mouth and intensivates when exhaling through the sniffing device. Finish: Very sweet yet warming but quite short (I know that some says it's long but not I). Which is fine, because then you just pour once again and start from the beginning. Only downside: It's just 50 cl. so you'll be out of ammo in no time. Thank God, they make so much of the that they are selling it !",0
835,2,Nikka,Fantastic!!!,"As all Japanese whiskies, this is just great and I just love the bottle.",0
836,2,Nikka,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,"I must admit is a really good whisky and good value for money,and I was never disappointed  with it yet.to Poor man's Aberlour a'Bunadh.You can't compare it to a'Bunadh..because it's a totally different stuff! It's like to compering a dick to  a door handle.",0
837,2,Nikka,Extraordinary and fabulous!!!,"For me this is same quality level with Yamazaki 18YO but much more affordable price, great value!",0
838,2,Nikka,"Burn, From the Barrel","Got a sample to try, and from a neat pour the nose at first was overpowered with the alcohol, so any notes were confused at first. But eventually vanilla bean, custard, and a faint hint of spice and musty, wet oak came thru. The sweet toffeed palate has a healthy burn. And the finish is perfectly long and oaky, but still a little hot with a touch of grassiness at the end.Very Japanese and very enjoyable in its own right. But this dram doesn't hold the heat from the 51.4% well. ",0
839,2,Nikka,Incredibly clean with a nice gentle burn.,"Tried this in a bar once, was my first Japanese Whisky. One of my all time favorites now, goes down like water but has a nice gentle burn after. Some great tastes. ",0
840,2,Nikka,Still one of my favorites,"I was fortunate to get a dram of this in an Asian Whiskey tasting.  For me, the Nikka stood out above the others, I had to get myself a bottle.  About 1/3 of a way through the bottle, and it's still one of my absolute favorites.",0
841,2,Nikka,I yield!,After all these years of looking down on blends I finally and gladly raise the white flag to this little stunner. I am disarmed and I willingly surrender... Marvelous.,0
842,2,Nikka,Possibly the most underrated Whisky.,"I have no doubt that in a blind taste test with much pricier, prestigious Whiskies, this unassuming little bottle would more than hold it's own. This would surly get a few discerning nods on the nose alone. Aroma science could be learnt from this dram alone it's that complex, but pleasurable too. Once you sip this stuff you can you can expect rapture. If you hadn't already guessed this would definitely be my Whisky of choice. It somehow manages to combine all the best attributes of Bourbon and Scotch. There's not much smoke going on here but everything else is covered, and done with sublime execution. All the things I look for in a good whisky are here. Vanilla first, followed by rich marmalade and dried fruit, followed by the best spice that doesn't have any peppery burn just luscious fruitcake spices. The finish Remains fruity but now it is rich caramelised Orange and chocolate for good measure. This is a true gourmand whisky. I'm not sure where Nikka are sourcing their barrels from but they are possibly the best barrels around. The Japanese sure know how to make whisky. If you like whisky, get this glorious liquid perfection. ",0
843,2,Nikka,One of a kind,"By far the most memorable Japanese whisky I've tried. If you're a bourbon fan like me, you'll love it.  Rich, flavoursome, delicious and unbelievably good value.",0
844,2,Nikka,Caramelised banana,"Is the first thing I discern from my bottle I bought some years ago on Edinburgh's Royal Mile. The alcohol burn slowly creeps up on you but never gets particularly harsh. A definite grassy aftertaste, with something milder than peat (muddy puddle?) around the edges. ",1
845,2,Nikka,Japanese Wonder,Well this whisky knows how to make an impact. Just a quick sniff will tell you this is a whisky which will pack a punch. Notes of oak and spice and a little smoke come through. At first sip you'll notice the impact of the 51% abv without it being too overwhelming which is impressive. A big taste of oak and even a little malt come through with some warming pepper which continues onto the finish with a little smokey hints. It's yet another example of why Japanese whiskies should be tried and taken seriously as a quality drink.,0
846,2,Nikka,Yabba dabba doo!,"Sometimes whiskies just come and slap you in the face and tell you that all of your previous beliefs about things. This is a big hit of ripe rich fruitcake and toasted almonds. Cinnamon and nutmeg notes add to the complexity. It's huge on flavour and that body and intensity along with the quality of spirit hide that 51% alcohol which seems to be smooth and soft in texture. It's Japanese, and it's a blend and it's totally awesome!",0
847,2,Nikka,Excellent,"This is a complex and demanding whisky. The nose entices with clove, lemon, satsuma, and honey. The palate mixes ginger, oak, vanilla, toffee, and blackcurrant. The finish is very long, with clove, black pepper, and fruity sweetness. The character of this whisky changes significantly with a little air, too. It softens and sweetens. Nikka is a new favourite!",0
848,2,Nikka,A Japanese Delight,"Nose: Treacle toffee, Icing sugar, Golden syrup, orange zest, dried fruit, apricot, a hint of smoke, buttermilk, some black tea and coffee.Palate: Toffee, vanilla, honey, cocoa, mixed fruit preserves, Jam tarts, some cinnamon, orange fruit juice and some creamy notes.Finish: A long and initially sweet finish with notes of almond, oak, some pepper spice and crisp fruit which turns increasingly dry into the close.",1
849,2,Nikka,Impressive,"Four of us compared this creation to the first half of the premium whisky calendar, so far it's got second place.I also like the shape of the compact bottle.",0
850,2,Nikka,A blocky little samurai bottling full of japanese spirit,"I bought this for a song in Tokyo, but it's worth searching out at the slightly higher price it's sold for abroad (MoM's pricing is pretty good, IMO). A high ABV blend that showcases good, inexpensive Japanese whisky. I'd also suggest that the idiosyncratic, miminalist bottling means this works well as a gift option.",0
851,2,Nikka,Unreal ,"So well made that you would think you are drinking a 40 percent whisky. Smooth, powerful and delicious. Should be ten times the price. Amazing ",0
852,2,Nikka,First nose,...would suggest a bourbon. Smells very sweet and fruity Its arrived at work and staring at me from under the monitor.  Cant wait to get home.  Love the clinical packaging.  ,1

855,2,Nikka,Good indeed,"Very highly recommended. Nice oiliness with spicy toffee and complex fruitiness. The blended whisky at so high strength is rarity, although this is probably not a cask strength whisky. ",0
856,2,Nikka,Mmmmmm,Just the bottle is something special. ,1
857,2,Nikka,Friends,"I thought I didn't like liquor. I got a bottle from my colleagues, and I do they like me! What incredible fellows! What an incredible taste and smell! Thanks, everyone.",0
858,2,Nikka,Winner,have enjoyed a few Japanese whiskies in my time. found a bottle of this by chance at the hotel I was staying at. since then I've made sure the barman keeps the bottle hidden until my return. well worth it,0
859,2,Nikka,great service ,"Bought this yesterday lunchtime as a gift, and it arrived perfectly packaged before 9am today! Very impressed, just hope the whisky is as good as the reviews say it is!",0
860,2,Nikka,Entrepreneur ,"I bought this whiskey not knowing anything about it! I saw a promotion online. Myself and my business partner have just opened this, and we are absolutely blown away. We just wish it came in a 750ml",0
861,2,Nikka,Poor man's Aberlour a'Bunadh,"Similar nose to Aberlour a'Bunadh, but weaker arrival and finish.  (And it's more expensive.)",1
862,2,Nikka,Mr fm Grimley,Nokia 21 pure malt. Up there with some of the west coast malts in Scotland. Full bodied fruity and crisp. Beautiful bottle only downside is a malt of this quality must have a cork not a screw top cap 10 out of 10.,0
863,2,Nikka,Also fantastic packaging,Pretty packaging also..,0
864,2,Nikka,Flipping great,"Got a bottle from local wine shop ( he has a decent whiskey range) and this Stuff is fantastic sure it's 50cl but 30 quid, for cask strength.. Great Japanese floral style and a big punch... Certainly a replacement for for cupboard job when gone. Top stuff and a bargin.",0
865,2,Nikka,Recommended,"Based on the Pure Malt White - though it's a good whisky - I wasn't really in a hurry to try this and so it's been sitting around for a couple months, but now I regret not getting to it sooner. Love the palate especially. Great price, but amazing whisky regardless.",0
866,2,Nikka,Would be a 10,Amazing dram. Would be a perfect ten if it were 70cl. ,0
867,2,Nikka,Very impressed,Wow! Firstly can I say what amazing service master of malt gives . I ordered  my bottle on a Monday eve and it was delivered tues when delivery was advised  by fri so very impressed.  It was packaged well so no chance of damage and the whiskey is presented in a chic black box which made me think what an excellent gift this would be for someone as the price is on point. However this time the gift was for me. Having worked in japan I understand their love of whisky which  is also where I picked up my taste for it. I hadn't tried this brand before but have to say I will def be purchasing again. Smooth but with a hitch of heat that leaves a delightful sensation as well as flavour. This yes please for me and will be recommending this website to everyone I know!!!!,0
868,2,Nikka,Day 3 of the Whisky Advent Calendar: My first ever Japanese,"I've never tried Japanese whisky before and until recently was oblivious to the fact that they're a renowned whisky producing nation. Absolutely the best blended whisky I've ever experienced. I don't see how this can be compared with a smoky, pungent Talisker. Such a lovely, spicy and woody aroma - I've kept a small drop in my Glencairn just to keep coming back to it without the alcohol hit.",0
869,2,Nikka,wasn't expecting a big bite,"I'm a bourbon lover, enjoy scotch, and also enjoy white dog. I found this to have a bit more heat than expected.I also bought a bottle of Super and hope it is a bit smoother.",1
870,2,Nikka,slightly changed since my last review,"Interesting. My previous bottle (2012) was distinctly sugared almonds. This time (2013) the packaging has changed & its generally drier with more attack - I suspect less aging which is a shame. Nose is remarkable - goes on and on. On the palate however that fierce attack is too much, a minty mouth numbing sensation, perhaps peat but no smoke. aftertaste is somewhat killed by the burning sensation.",1
871,2,Nikka,forgot to rate it!,Forgot the 10 stars it deserves!,0
872,2,Nikka,Really Loved It! ,"What can I say, I am not an expert of whiskey by any stretch of the imagination (although I have drunk all sorts) but it clearly came across this was really good.I would highly recommend you try this beauty!!!",0
873,2,Nikka,To try!,A basic japanese whisky with an amazing rapport quality/price !!!Highly recommended especially for novices who want to discover the Japanese whiskey.,0
874,2,Nikka,And here is my rating (missing from above..doh!),"Only losing points for not being as focused as my preferred single malts, and having a distinct Kentucky feel to it. How they likened it to Talisker and not makers mark is a poor reflection on the shop staff. That not withstanding, I would never have considered trying it without their shnaffoo, so can't really grumble. Fallen on a diamond in the ruff. ",1
875,2,Nikka,All of the above...and then some!,"Fairly new to the drink myself and currently working through the classic malts. I found this on quest for Oban (which is going to have to wait)and bought it as the store keeper picked up on my love of Talisker and said I'd like this. It is NOTHING like talisker but, I DO love this! I rarely take my drink neat but this is different. I was snobbish about blends, but again, this is different. Its nose is rich and pungent but very bourbon like. I was immediately reminded of makers mark dipped cigars. But on the tongue it has so many flavors, the one that stands out is licorice root. WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM?? I could sniff this all day but I am afraid it might be addictive. I've just started on my whiskey shelf at home and this is going to be a show stopper. Can't wait to share it with loved ones. ",0
876,2,Nikka,"Aktonbo!,,","Yama surge, koneshiwa arigoto!",1
877,2,Nikka,what a brew ! ,All I can say is that this is absolutely delicious ! I've tried a LOT of whiskies from a lot of countries and this is simply stunning ! ,0
878,2,Nikka,I wrote just getting familiar above,"And now I know for sure why many rave about this.  It really is fantastic.  Last night I was taking those prefect hummingbird sized drop-sips, and I really experienced the texture and amazing flavor of this whisky.  I have yet to try with a drop of water, but I don't know how soon I will, because it is fantastic neat,.and a prefect slow sipper.  Again, maybe bc of strength, but I find the buzz from this unique and very desirable.  Now I'm trying to figure out how I might b able to get more than the 4 I already have into my suitcase along with: yoichi and miyagikyo no age statements, nikka 12 year pure malt, yamazaki 10 yr single malt, Yoichi 10 , and Miyagikyo 10.",0
879,2,Nikka,best of the best,best of the best,0
880,2,Nikka,Just getting familiar,"scared at first when I nosed one of the bottles i bought here in Japan, because it is strronng. But now when I open the bottle for a sniff, wow, very much bourbon like sweetness, can't wait to experiment with small drops of water with small servings of this whisky to see what that does. But I generally like to drink neat, and so I do here. The nose can be so wonderful and I detect lovely favors on the tongue with a fiery sensation on the way down.  But at over 50% that is to be expected..all I know so far is that I like this whisky more and more with each try.  And the buzz is very very nice..Does anyone from m.o.m. or anywhere else know if it is true that this and other tasty whiskies really have color added? I don't even know if that has a bad connotation to it; and even tho the majority of reviews online have people saying they love this whisky (and many say it is one of the best bargain quality whiskies in the world), one guy didn't have nice things to say and added that this was another dram with color added.Anyone privy?",0

883,2,Nikka,Absolutely Delicious ,"I am far from a whiskey connoisseur but I have to write this review, I had my first taste of Whisky in the form of Johnnie Walker about 6 months ago, from that moment I knew I had found my goto alcohol to unwind and relax with. Since that moment 6 months ago I have tried Glenlivet, Glenfiddich, Famous Grouse, Talisker and Jamesons. I thought I had Whisky pegged, but I just got this today and I can honestly say its the best whiskey Ive tasted so far, it hits your mouth like Johnnie Walker but the taste a few seconds after is amazing, it almost turns into a liquor taste as the flavour becomes very creamy, but still packs the amazing feeling drinking whisky gives. Like I said I'm no where near an expert on this stuff, but to topple all those other brands Ive tasted, this whisky is something special.",0
884,2,Nikka,"Wonderful. Bourbon influence, remarkable value ","Incredible value for an exceptional whiskey. Matured in Bourbon hogsheads I imagine because it's heading in that direction - not a 'Scotch' wannabe in any way. Despite strength (50%?) its smooth and rounded enough to drink neat. Aftertaste goes on forever, some peat, rich mouthfeel, complex nose with orange peel/ almonds/ coconut/ peat and plenty more.Shame it's only 50cl.Packageing is quite special - a great present. Scotch connoiseurs might not enjoy because it isnt an immitator. But if you have an open mind, this will be a firm favourite and worth tracking down.",0
885,2,Nikka,Beautiful,It's really beautiful whisky .. but only what i want to know is how many years is matured ? or this information is unknown ? can somebody help me with it ? ,0
886,2,Nikka,Amazing whisky,"I just tried this last night thanks to a friend having a bottle.This is an exquisite whisky.Amazing nose, I could sit sniffing it in for hours!Very good and rich palate!I must get one for myself soon!",0
887,2,Nikka,A good birthday present,This whiskey was bought for me as a present and I found it to be very pleasant but stronger than my usual scotch. It was better than I expected; I wouldn't have had the Japanese down as accomplished whiskey makers. I would buy it again and would recommend it.,0
888,2,Nikka,Value for money,"What value! I know it's only a 50cl bottle, but still, touch of peat too. Great stuff...",0
